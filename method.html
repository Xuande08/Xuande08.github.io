			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Goals of measuring happiness in the present research were to construct a survey and poll the citizens of an area to better understand how their well-being was affected by their city of residence.
			Using that data, we would compare the different cities in that area and evaluate which provided greater happiness and what each city might do to increase its residents&#39; well-being. 
			We constructed the survey as a group after determining the five factors listed above that largely come from a city environment and affect the well-being of those within the environment, which are safety, education, available resources, health, and entertainment.
			Drawing from the research above, general demographic information about each city, and personal perceptions of what components constitute each of the five factors, we wrote items for the survey to measure how well participants believed their cities fulfilled those needs and to what degree that influenced their happiness with their city.
			Each item on the survey asks participates to rate a statement from 1 to 5, with 1 corresponding to strong disagreement with the statement and 5 to strong agreement.

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Residents of Liberty and Excelsior Springs, Missouri were asked to participate in our survey. 
Our researchers distributed paper surveys individually in popular retail establishments within each city and electronically with the help of the Excelsior Springs Chamber of Commerce. 
Anyone who was 18 to 55 years of age and a resident of one of the two cities was allowed to participate in the survey. No incentives or rewards were offered in exchange for participation. 
Responses were voluntary and anonymous after obtaining written consent to participation. A total of 38 surveys were collected with 19 from each city.
</p>
<hr />
<b>Items and their Relevance</b><br /><br />

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At the beginning of the survey were simple demographic identifiers to examine any trends related to gender, age, and how long participants have lived in their cities. 
For instance, if the data showed a large number of individuals who lived in the city for long periods of time, we may want to investigate what factors are influencing their decision to stay there, especially whether it is actually due to positive attributes of the city itself or whether it is more because of external factors such as family in the area, job security, or inability to relocate to somewhere more desirable to each individual.
 After these demographics, participants responded to forty items encompassing our five identified factors and direct measures of perceived well-being.
 </p>
 <p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Safety is represented in the survey by statements such as, &#34;I feel safe walking alone around town,&#34; and &#34;I trust my neighbours to watch my home and belongings.&#34;
 These kinds of items are aimed at identifying not only how people perceive their safety but to what degree they feel that their environment has established community values.
 Community and trust are crucial components to individual well-being as they provides a stable foundation for emotional safety in addition to physical safety.
</p>
<p>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Available resources, in our survey, refers to finances, helpfulness of neighbours, and stores in the city that provide necessities such as groceries and clothing.
 The category also refers to participants&#39; proximity to schools and their jobs.
 Statements like, &#34;I grocery shop in town,&#34; and &#34;I enjoy my current job,&#34; help us determine whether the town provides an adequate amount of businesses and establishments to meet the citizens demands.
 These questions pertain to well-being in multiple ways.
 For instance, if a large portion of people do their shopping out of town, they are using time, vehicle fuel, and money that could all be saved if grocery stores closer to home could fulfill their needs. 
 If many people indicate that they are unhappy with their jobs, not only are their individual well-beings directly affected, but that also shows a need for economic improvement to provide better jobs and increase productivity.
 As jobs occupy much of each person&#39;s life, people working in a position that causes unhappiness wastes potential for their own well-being and potential for them to improve the situation of others.
</p>
<p>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Health as a factor examines a city&#39;s hospitals and clinics as well as whether residents believe their city facilitates a healthy style of life.
 Items on the survey asked participants directly to rate their agreement with the statements, &#34;There are a variety of health care options here,&#34; &#34;The health care options are of high quality,&#34; and, &#34;This town allows me to have a healthy lifestyle.&#34; Having such services readily available contributes to actual health as well as peace of mind.
 Gyms, fresh foods, clean air and outdoor spaces, and other infrastructure meant to promote good health are important to well-being as being active and eating nutritiously can both make people feel better while living their lives and extend the length of their lives.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fourth factor regarded entertainment provided by the city. 
A few items in this category were, &#34;I usually stay in town for entertainment,&#34; and, &#34;I like the bars in my town.&#34; 
Entertainment is important to many people because it allows them to unwind, to express aspects of themselves not represented in their jobs, and to build meaningful relationships with others in their community. 
Like available resources, if people are most often driving out of town to meet their entertainment needs, they are wasting time, fuel, and money that could be better spent if they could meet these needs within city limits.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Items focused on education directed participants&#39; attention to their city&#39;s available school systems including elementary through high school. 
These items addressed the programs within the schools with statements like, &#34;The schools have plenty of activities and clubs,&#34; and &#34;I am pleased with schools musical and theater programs.&#34;  
The purpose of the education category was to gauge the opinion of recent graduates and parents in regards to whether they believed their schools sufficiently provide them and their children with the curriculum and programs that can most help them become successful and happy.
 This measurement includes electives, creative programs, clubs, and activities for students who wish to explore more than core subjects. 
 Schools, especially public schools, play an important part role in influencing well-being because general education affects all aspects of life both while students are in school and in their futures. 
 It also affects how students interact with each other and the community as adults. 
 Education can promote better understanding of oneself and one&#39;s needs, helping individuals to change and improve their own well-being and the well-being of those around them within the other four qualities of well-being addressed in this study.
</p>
 <hr />
 <b>Methods of Analysis</b><br /><br />
<p>In addition to items related to each of the five factors, direct items asking participants to rate their enjoyment of and satisfaction with their city were included to compare well-being between the two cities. 
Averages for each item, direct measures of happiness and statements within the factors alike, within each city were compared to the corresponding average of the other city. 
This provides a simple way to see which city has a greater amount of satisfaction in a particular area.
 We then examined correlations of the items within the factors with the items directly measuring well-being in order to determine which of these factors might have the most influence on quality of life.
