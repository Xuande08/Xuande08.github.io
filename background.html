			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the task of evaluating the well-being of residents in the area near Liberty, Missouri, the researchers of this study chose to survey residents of Liberty and Excelsior Springs, MO about their satisfaction with the city in which they live and with five factors affected by that city that likely influence its residents well-being. The five factors, determined by reviewing literature on previous studies regarding well-being and by concepts learned from Wheelan (2010), McKibben (2007), and Bok (2010), were...

			<p><b>Factors Affecting Well-Being</b></p><br />
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Money is often the first issue that comes to mind when people consider the factors that create their well-being, but upon closer examination it is clear that there are many more factors that promote a healthy quality of life. Stories of the rich and famous who are still unable to avoid depression and about the lottery winners who realize that their lives were much happier before their bank account balances increased in digits are familiar to most people in Western culture today. Even more common are students who elect not to immediately enter the work force after high school graduation, but to attend a higher education institution instead and go into debt in order to eventually receive a higher pay rate. Money provides many necessities, but it is not the deciding influence on the state of one&#39;s well-being. So, in judging whether residents&#39; well-being may be higher in one city compared to another, there are many factors to consider that may matter more than the cities&#39; median salaries.
			</p>

			<p id="health"><b>Health</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When it comes to the relationship of health to well-being, individual perception is reality. In many situations, a general idea of what it means to be healthy may not be fitting for every person. If a man were to have a limb removed in order to prevent an infection from spreading, the amputation would increase his health; however, whether his well-being was increased or decreased will depend on his personal outlook&#45;whether he is optimistic or pessimistic (Raibley, 2013). It is clear that &#34human flourishing depends substantially on the verdicts of our emotional natures, to a significant extent independently of what we think about our lives&#34 (Raibley, 2013, p. 8). Health is a very important factor of people&#39;s well-being, emotionally and physically.
	`	`	</p>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many studies have concluded that it is self-perceived health that affects well-being (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010). For instance, a woman may fit or even fall below the standard medical definition of an appropriate weight for her height and age, but if she believes the number on her scale is too high, her psychological well-being is decreased despite her friends&#39;, family&#39;s, doctor&#39;s, and even society&#39;s assurances that she is healthy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Quantifying the relationship between well-being and health is quite difficult. It is invalid to assume that duration of life, which can easily be measured, increases well-being, for it is the quality of life that is most important (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010).  However, individuals with positive well-being often experience longevity due to healthy habits or behaviors. In numerous studies, positive well-being was highly correlated with those who were medically healthy and had healthy work atmospheres, healthy family relationships, low risks of illnesses, and high productivity (Lyubomirsky, 2005).

<p id="safe"><b>Safety</b></p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Happiness and physical health are very dependent upon the ability to feel safe in one&#39;s environment. Naturally, most people would like to live in an area that allows them to feel secure with their surroundings and secure about the safety of their friends and loved ones. Among western democracies, the United States rates very high in homicides, robberies, and assaults; in fact, people between the ages of 14 and 30 are more likely to die from homicide than from any other cause, excluding unintentional injuries (McGarrell, 2010). It is all the more important for one&#39;s well-being, then, that one reside in a city that allows one to live more than to worry.
</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Safety is a factor that is quite easy to measure. Crime rates and the overall &#34;vibe&#34; of an area may convey to visitors whether or not they should feel safe. Jones (2006) conducted a study comparing crime rates of low income and middle income homes. The result suggested that people living in an area in which the median income was above $30,000 experienced less crime than those in an area with a median income below the same amount.
</p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Although crime is a significant factor of people&#39;s safety, it is surely not the only one. The safety of the roads in a town can either lead to positive well-being or they can be very detrimental. Cities that have high accident rates usually have poor road conditions and/or busy intersections.

<p id="resource"><b>Available Resources</b></p>	
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well-being is also influenced by the range and availability of resources that a city is able to offer. At the most basic level, a city should provide energy, water, and food (Heaven, 2014). These things are taken for granted by many U.S. residents, who are used to having them at the reach of their fingertips, as they usually do. For those people, the absence of one of these resources would likely be detrimental to well-being, but residents of urban areas that are labeled &#34;food deserts&#34; understand the importance of nearby resources more than most.
</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Public transportation is another important resource. Not everyone has the pleasure of a personal vehicle, and those who do may not have the necessary income to operate and take care of it, so public transportation such as trains, buses, and taxis are essential. It is not only important for them to exist but also for them to be accessible enough to reach jobs and attractions that increase well-being (Heaven, 2014).

<p id="entertainment"><b>Entertainment</b></p>	
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Access to a great education is also vital to residents&#39; well-being. A city that does not well educate its children and teens creates generations of poverty and perpetuates health risks. According to many studies, people that receive an additional four years of school (high school) live 1.8% longer than those who do not, are 2.16 percentage points less at risk for heart disease, and are 1.3% less likely to have diabetes (Picker, 2007) .
Furthermore, those who are more educated are less likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as stroke, hypertension, emphysema, and bad cholesterol. Statistics also show that when the more educated do become ill with these diseases they are still less likely to die from them than are those with less education (Picker, 2007). Picker (2007) writes, &#34;Those with more years of schooling are less likely to smoke, to drink heavily, to be overweight or obese, or to use illegal drugs.&#34; Education is not only reflective in health, but also in finances, as every year of additional schooling raises potential earnings by ten percent (Picker, 2007).

<p id="education"><b>Education</b></p>	
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To our knowledge, little if any literature exists discussing the influence of hobbies, community activities, and other forms of entertainment on personal or communal well-being. However, from our own perspectives and experiences, we believe that whether one is satisfied with one&#39;s options for occupying one&#39;s leisure time is important for overall happiness. The gap in published studies perhaps points to a need for research on this factor rather than to a lack of effect.
