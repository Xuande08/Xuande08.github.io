			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the task of evaluating the well-being of residents in the area near Liberty, Missouri, the researchers of this study chose to survey residents of Liberty and Excelsior Springs, MO about their satisfaction with the city in which they live and with five factors affected by that city that likely influence its residents well-being. The five factors, determined by reviewing literature on previous studies regarding well-being and by concepts learned from Wheelan (2010), McKibben (2007), and Bok (2010), were...

			<p><b>Factors Affecting Well-Being</b></p><br />
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Money is often the first issue that comes to mind when people consider the factors that create their well-being, but upon closer examination it is clear that there are many more factors that promote a healthy quality of life. Stories of the rich and famous who are still unable to avoid depression and about the lottery winners who realize that their lives were much happier before their bank account balances increased in digits are familiar to most people in Western culture today. Even more common are students who elect not to immediately enter the work force after high school graduation, but to attend a higher education institution instead and go into debt in order to eventually receive a higher pay rate. Money provides many necessities, but it is not the deciding influence on the state of one&#39;s well-being. So, in judging whether residents&#39; well-being may be higher in one city compared to another, there are many factors to consider that may matter more than the cities&#39; median salaries.

			<p>When it comes to the relationship of health to well-being, individual perception is reality. In many situations, a general idea of what it means to be healthy may not be fitting for every person. If a man were to have a limb removed in order to prevent an infection from spreading, the amputation would increase his health; however, whether his well-being was increased or decreased will depend on his personal outlook—whether he is optimistic or pessimistic (Raibley, 2013). It is clear that &#34human flourishing depends substantially on the verdicts of our emotional natures, to a significant extent independently of what we think about our lives&#34 (Raibley, 2013, p. 8). Health is a very important factor of people’s well-being, emotionally and physically.
Many studies have concluded that it is self-perceived health that affects well-being (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010). For instance, a woman may fit or even fall below the standard medical definition of an appropriate weight for her height and age, but if she believes the number on her scale is too high, her psychological well-being is decreased despite her friends’, family’s, doctor’s, and even society’s assurances that she is healthy.
Quantifying the relationship between well-being and health is quite difficult. It is invalid to assume that duration of life, which can easily be measured, increases well-being, for it is the quality of life that is most important (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010).  However, individuals with positive well-being often experience longevity due to healthy habits or behaviors. In numerous studies, positive well-being was highly correlated with those who were medically healthy and had healthy work atmospheres, healthy family relationships, low risks of illnesses, and high productivity (Lyubomirsky, 2005).
