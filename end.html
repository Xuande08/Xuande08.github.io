<b>Wheelan</b><br /><br />
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wheelan (2010) introduced us to the concept of capability.
<b>The more &#34;information&#34; community members have, the more capable they are of pursuing well-being (p. 108). </b>
According to Wheelan, individuals are primarily interested in the self, working to better their own economic situation before thinking of anyone else&#39;s. 
Access to information makes this endeavor more fruitful, as the individual is better equipped to pursue their version of well-being. 
Thus, in this case, information refers to anything that would offer an advantage to the individual in the market.
 Wheelan gives the example of a person buying a used car&#45;knowing what to look for better equips the buyer to make the best investment possible.  
 The same goes for accessing healthcare and wrestling with insurance companies.
 While we asked our subjects if they were satisfied with their area&#39;s schools and healthcare resources (as far as quality and variety), we failed to assess the reach of information in the two municipalities. 

 <b>Even if there are a variety of good schools and healthcare resources, lack of information might limit an individual&#39;s access.</b> <br />

<b>McKibben</b><br /><br />
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe met several different types of communities in Bill McKibben&#39;s book, Deep Economy (2007), all of which shared the aspect of a deep-rooted sense of connectedness. 
Whether it was the ingeniousness of Curitiba in Brazil or the sustainable town in Gorasin, McKibben&#39;s examples always encouraged the reader to seek out places that were resourceful on their own. 
Both Liberty and Excelsior Springs rely on huge corporations such as Wal-Mart and HYVEE for their resources. 
In hindsight, the survey should have included questions regarding community-oriented resources such as farmer&#39;s markets or food drives done in each municipality in order to better discern whether there is a sense of commitment to community in either town.
 McKibben argues that the self has completely overwhelmed society, so that now we are not communities but rather &#34;hyper-individualists&#34; (p. 97). 
 Both Excelsior Springs and Liberty are suburban cities, so even if they were generally neutral on the topic of whether they worried about their property being stolen, this is likely due more to the fact that their property is not easily accessible to most of the people around them rather than to a sense of trust or relationships with their neighbors.
 If McKibben were analyzing these two municipalities, he might be concerned, as we are, that there was not a higher level of trust among participants and their neighbors.

<b>Bok</b><br /><br />

 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBok&#39;s book, Exploring Happiness (2010), offers a history on research done on the definition of happiness and how to achieve it. 
 From Bok we learn that &#34;people regularly report being happier in societies that enjoy high standards of living&#34; (p. 142). 
We asked our subjects if they felt that their happiness depended on their income, but according to Bertrand Russel as cited by Bok, &#34;The most basic form of happiness is available to human beings&#46;&#46;&#46;regardless of their level of education, so long as they enjoy health and physical vigor, loving relationships, and a sense of achievement in life, of overcoming obstacles&#34; (p. 134).
 Along with asking our subjects if they felt that their happiness was directly correlated with their income, we also should have asked more questions that probed the ability of the municipality to provide spaces to further their health as well as places to build lasting relationships. 
 These types of places would include gyms, community centers, parks, and as previously mentioned, farmer&#39;s markets and other community driven events.
Bok (2010) also touches on the issues of illusion and delusion in the pursuit of happiness.
 Bok gives us Lycas as an example, who was completely happy but was under the illusion that theatrical performances were constantly being performed around him. 
 While Lycas was immensely happy in his delusion, his family found the situation troubling.
 In light of this, we could have asked participants about their perception of the ability of their friends and family to be happy within their city (provided as it was the same as the participant&#39;s own). 
 Such questions might have provided insight as to whether happiness and satisfaction within each city could be attributed to illusion.
</p>
<p>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another of Bok&#39;s (2010) considerations is religion, especially Christianity in the Western world, which can be discussed in terms of an illusion that makes people feel a sense of purpose and understand their place in the world.
We did not ask a single question on religion in our survey, which we see as a vast oversight considering illusion was one of the main avenues to happiness discussed by Bok.
 Community members might derive their happiness from their respective illusions, in which case the availability of, say, a church in which to practice a religion would be a priority when choosing a place to live.
 Finally, Bok cites Seneca, who essentially promotes the renunciation of the self and even of hyper-individualism.
 Seneca writes that being kind to others without expecting anything in return is one way of bringing &#34;peace and harmony of the soul&#34; (p. 62).
 Community service is a prime example of this sort of behavior, and further studies should include questions on the opportunities for community service in the two municipalities.

<b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In conclusion, our process included several key issues of well-being as delineated by Wheelan (2010), Mckibben (2007), and Bok (2010).
 These include access to information, access to resources locally, and the issue of the necessity of wealth for the achievement of happiness.
 Upon inspection of our process, which consisted of surveys distributed to members of the two municipalities, there are several other areas which would have been productive to explore in determining the cities&#39; respective levels of well-being.
 These include analyzing the reach of the information available in both municipalities, analyzing the respective levels of community oriented behaviors, and evaluating the access to illusions such as religion (in the form of churches and other areas of worship).
 By adding these factors, we feel our process would have been more well-rounded and would have accurately fit what we have learned of well-being from our readings.
 Despite these shortcomings, our study still adequately covered the five factors of health, safety, resource availability, entertainment, and education, finding that lack of quality entertainment and higher crime rates are the main qualities that make residents of Excelsior Springs less satisfied with their city than residents of Liberty.
